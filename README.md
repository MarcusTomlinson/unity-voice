# Simple command and control voice recognition

Using [pocketsphinx ](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx), this project provides a simple DBus API and C++/Qt client library that lets you specify a list of commands and then picks the most likely one from the user's speech into the microphone. Commands are provided as a simple list of string lists.
